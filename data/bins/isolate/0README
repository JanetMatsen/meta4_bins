        modified:   get_isolate_genomes.sh                  
        renamed:    make_gff_from_fna.sh -> scripts/make_gff_from_fna.sh  
        renamed:    prepare_bins.py -> scripts/prepare_bins.py

Steps:
- original fasta and genbank files were moved from Hyak into the 
  orignals directory.  See README in there. 
- run the shell script get_isolate_genomes.sh 
    - activates m4_janalysis virtualenv
    - calls ./scripts/prepare_bins.py
    - calls ./scripts/make_gff_from_fna.sh

prepare_bins.py loops over the fasta and genbannk files in original and
copies them to ./bins/ with better names, thanks to the help of SeqIO.

make_gff_from_fna.sh is a mostly-Dave script that makes .gff from genbank
files using the program readseq.jar
