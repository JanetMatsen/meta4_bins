We originally downloaded the isolate genomes as one file.
Dave broke them apart usint SQL at /work/dacb/extract_isolates on waffle.
Copy them over here. 

Steps:
- copy .fasta files from /work/dacb/extract_isolates to ./bins
- TODO: make individual .genbank files and copy them over. 
- TODO: make .gff from .genbank
    - e.g. make_gff_from_fna.sh (a mostly-Dave script that makes .gff from genbank files using the program readseq.jar)
