Files were originally downloaded from JGI using files.list and fetch.
Those files were only temporarily available.

Some bin names needed to be fixed: see fix_names.sh
Before running that script, a copy of the data was saved to /gscratch/lidstrom/meta4_bins/data/unaltered_genome_bins
As the script runs, it saves a copy of the files to the dir bins_pre_renaming
make_fasta and make_genbank were re-run after this alteration on 5/5/2016

Efficacy was checked with check_renaming.sh

Should be fine to add subsequent renaming function calls in fix_names.sh
